## Design

### Color Scheme

* #FFFFFF White was used as the main colour of the website to give it a simplistic and clean look. White conveys a sense of freedom and it gives the user the visual breathing space to absorb the information presented on the screen.
  
* #252525 Very dark gray was used for text, separation of content and the footer. This worked well to contrast with the white background. It created a website that was accessible to read.
  
* rgba(228, 121, 33) Deep shade of orange was used for the logo, cover text overlay and for all the responsive buttons and social media icons when hovered over and the background on the images in gallery when hovered over. Orange is a warm and welcoming color for the user. Orange gives a sense of warmth and compassion which will create a sense of a soothing and safe environment whilst on the page reasuring parents that this is a safe drama club to send their child to. Psychologically, in business applications orange gives the impression of affordability which will also attract the user as the visitors of this website will already undoubtedly be budgeting their finances for different recreational activities for their child.



### Typography

<img width="227" alt="lato" src="https://github.com/mcallisterliza/drama-kids/assets/145555751/7fcb2585-5a72-41af-89b0-548eb8db0393">

* Lato Google Font was used as the main font of the website as it ensured that the website was readable and accessible.

<img width="225" alt="roboto" src="https://github.com/mcallisterliza/drama-kids/assets/145555751/0ecaf28a-8b2c-4aa7-826d-de7097ad236a">


- Roboto Google Font was used for the main logo and headings to attract the user's attention whilst also being accessible to read.

## Future improvements

- I would like to improve the quality of my commit messages. I am aware at times that some of my commit messages may not be very clear and this is something I look forward to improving in my future projects.
  
- I would like to have put more content onto my gallery page such as interactive figurecaptions so when the user hovered over the images styled figurecaptions appeared and gave the user more information about the benefits of the activities that the children were particpating in. An example of this would be when the image of the children playing mime games was hovered over a styles figurecaption would appear as an overlay of the image may note: "Mime is a fun and creative form of imaginitive play which allows the participant to develop their communication skills without the use of speech".
  
- I would like to have put an interactive map on the 'Contact Us' page where the user could clearly see the location of Drama Kids! on the map and zoom in and out of the location to plan their journey to the sessions
