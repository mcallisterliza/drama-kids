## Features

### Navbar

+ ##### Navigation
    - The nav bar is located at the top of the page.
    - Within the nav bar, there is the Drama Kids! logo for the company. The company logo is also responsive. When the user hovers over the Drama Kids! logo the letters change to different colors.
    - The nav bar also contains three links on the right-hand side:
        * HOME - This leads the user to the Home page where they can navigate through the company's 'About Us' section, the address and opening times, reviews from clients and a footer with links to the company's social media pages.
        * GALLERY - This leads the user to the gallery where the user can view images of different Drama Kids! members participating in performing arts workshops.
        * CONTACT US - This leads the user to the contact page where they can contact the company and request whether to join the mailing list or request a callback for further information.
    - The above links have an animated hover effect which underlines the words with orange to keep in with the page's color scheme.

      ![Navigation](documentation/navigation.png)

           ![Nav bar with dropdown](documentation/navigation_dropdown.png)

      **Rainbow Surprise**

      The h1 element/logo has a feature added to it that is not obvious to the user when they first view the page. If the user hovers the cursor over the h1/logo the letters d, r, a, m, a, k, i, d, s and ! change to different colors respectively. This is a 'hidden gem' on the page for playfulness. It gives the page a sense of playfulness and positivity which is what a child's drama group should reflect.

## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](documentation/color_scheme.png)

* #FFFFFF White was used as the main color of the website to give it a simplistic and clean look. White conveys a sense of freedom and it gives the user the visual breathing space to absorb the information presented on the screen.
  
* #252525 Very dark gray was used for text, separation of content and the footer. This worked well to contrast with the white background. It created a website that was accessible to read.
  
* #e47921 A deep shade of orange was used for the logo, cover text overlay and for all the responsive buttons and social media icons when hovered over and the background on the images in the gallery when hovered over. Orange is a warm and welcoming color for the user. Orange gives a sense of warmth and compassion which will create a sense of a soothing and safe environment whilst on the page reassuring parents that this is a safe drama club to send their child to. Psychologically, in business applications orange gives the impression of affordability which will also attract the user as the visitors of this website will already undoubtedly be budgeting their finances for different recreational activities for their child.



### Typography

![Lato Font](documentation/font_lato.png)

* Lato Google Font was used as the main font of the website as it ensured that the website was readable and accessible.

![Roboto Font](documentation/font_roboto.png)


- Roboto Google Font was used for the main logo and headings to attract the user's attention whilst also being accessible to read.

### Responsiveness
- The website was checked with the responsive viewer in Chrome to assess responsiveness on different screen sizes.
 ![Responsive screenshot](documentation/responsive_screenshot.png)

### Compatibility
- To confirm the correct functionality, responsiveness, and appearance the website was tested successfully on Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.



### Fixed Bugs

- When I deployed my project to Github pages I realized that my website was not working correctly as the four images from my reviews section were showing as broken links. After some investigation, I realized that I had used incorrect file paths in my code. In my code was: "/assets/images/pic2.png". After revisiting the lesson on file paths I realized I needed to remove the first slash from this code for my images to work. Once I removed this slash my images were working.
  
- When I ran Lighthouse on my project I had an error message for my call to action button for accessibility. After reading the guidance from Lighthouse and re-examining my code I realized that my aria label did not match the text shown to the user on the button. I corrected this error and ran Lighthouse again and gained 100% for accessibility.
  
- When I deployed my project to Github I realized that my hero image did not scroll with the rest of the homepage content. I revisited my CSS code and realized that I had positioned my hero image as 'fixed'. I corrected this and when I viewed my live project again my hero image scrolled as originally planned.
  
- When I ran my HTML code through the HTML validator I received error messages for unexpected slashes in self-closing tags. I revisited my code and used the HTML error message as guidance. I then went to the referenced line of code and found the error. I corrected this by removing the slash. I then ran my HTML through the validator once more and the result came back with no error messages.
  
- When I ran Lighthouse on my project my performance score was extremely low and this was due to the large images I have in my project. I spent a lot of time compressing each image over and over again. I added my new compressed images and ran Lighthouse again. My performance score greatly improved however it still stated that my images were too big. I once again attempted to compress the images further but unfortunately, I could not compress the images any further without resulting in very poor image quality. Therefore I kept the images as they were. My performance score has greatly improved since I compressed my images but I am unable to compress them any further.


### Unfixed Bugs

- On screen sizes similar to tablets I have found that my footer has 2 white lines running horizontally through the black footer. Before submitting this project I did not have time to investigate and fix this bug. I will however revisit this at a later date to find out how to correct this error for my learning.

## Deployment

## Future improvements

- I would like to improve the quality of my 'commit' messages. I am aware at times that some of my commit messages may not be very clear and this is something I look forward to improving in my future projects.
  
- I would like to have put more content onto my gallery page such as interactive 'figure-captions' so when the user hovered over the images, styled 'figure-captions' appeared and gave the user more information about the benefits of the activities that the children were participating in. An example of this would be when the image of the children playing mime games was hovered over, a styled 'figure-caption' would appear as an overlay of the image may note: "Mime is a fun and creative form of imaginative play which allows the participant to develop their communication skills without the use of speech".
  
- I would like to have put an interactive map on the 'Contact Us' page where the user could clearly see the location of Drama Kids! on the map and zoom in and out of the location to plan their journey to the sessions.
